## Somnia Reactivity Mini Hackathon

Welcome to Somnia Reactivity Mini Hackathon, a global, online event taking place from Feb 25th to March 20th, 2026.

The Somnia Reactivity Mini Hackathon invites developers and builders to explore Somnia Native On-chain Reactivity and build the first generation of truly reactive dApps on blockchain. Reactivity isn't just an incremental improvement, it's a paradigm shift that enables real-time, trustless and decentralised reactions without relying on external systems.

This hackathon is a chance to experiment, prototype, and showcase potential use cases of this breakthrough technology to the Web3 developer ecosystem.

### Timeline
- **Hackathon Kickoff:** Feb 25th, 2026
- **Submission Window:** Feb 25th – March 20th, 2026

### Prizes
- 300$ worth SOMI tokens to each winner project.
- Social media spotlight for winner projects and mentorship support.
- Select projects will be converted into tutorials, case studies, and reference implementations to support future developers.

### Track
There is one open track. Your project must integrate Somnia Reactivity to build a functional prototype that utilises the SDK in a meaningful way.

### Judging criteria
- **Technical Excellence** - Is the project functional, stable, and well-implemented using Reactivity SDK?
- **Real-Time UX** - Does it leverage the real time feature of Reactivity effectively?
- **Somnia Integration** - Is it Deployed on Somnia testnet?
- **Potential Impact** - Does it have potential to evolve into a real product or ecosystem contribution?

### About Somnia
Somnia is a high-performance, cost-efficient EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain capable of processing over 1,000,000 transactions per second (TPS) with sub-second finality. It is suitable for serving millions of users and building real-time mass-consumer applications like games, social applications, metaverses, and more, all fully on-chain.

## What is Reactive Tower Arena?

A skill-based arcade shooter where gameplay, competition, and leaderboard synchronization are powered entirely by on-chain event-driven architecture.

This is not a Web2 game with blockchain storage. This is a real-time reactive on-chain gaming prototype designed to demonstrate how Somnia enables mass-consumer, real-time applications without polling or centralized backends.

### Core Gameplay Loop

1. **Aim and Shoot** — Control a cannon, aim with mouse, hold click to charge power, release to fire energy projectiles at the tower. Physics-based collision system with skill-based aiming mechanics.

2. **Destroy Towers** — Each block has HP. Damage decreases HP per hit. Combo multiplier for consecutive hits. Critical hit mechanic (12% chance, boosted by power charge) deals 3x damage.

3. **Progressive Levels** — Clear all blocks to unlock next level. Increasing tower density, HP values, movement patterns (oscillating blocks from level 3+), and speed. Difficulty scales dynamically.

4. **Submit Score On-Chain** — When a session ends, player submits final score. Smart contract validates and records. Emits `ScoreSubmitted(address player, uint256 score)`. Score becomes immutable, verifiable, and global.

## Real-Time Competitive Layer (The Core Innovation)

### Live Global Leaderboard
- Top 10 global players
- Global high score tracking
- Personal best

### Event-Driven Architecture

When ANY player submits a score:
- Smart contract emits `ScoreSubmitted` and `NewGlobalLeader` (if applicable)
- Frontend uses Somnia Reactivity SDK (WebSocket event subscription)
- All connected users receive the event instantly
- Leaderboard updates live across all clients

**None of this uses:**
- `setInterval()` or polling
- Backend servers
- WebSocket relay servers

Pure on-chain reactivity.

### Spectator Mode

Anyone can open the spectator page and watch live score submissions. The UI animates in real-time without a wallet connection. Demonstrates mass-consumer scalability — unlimited concurrent viewers via event subscriptions.

## Technical Architecture

```
+---------------------+     Events (WebSocket)     +----------------------+
|   React Frontend    | <-------------------------> |  Somnia Testnet      |
|                     |                             |  (ChainID: 50312)    |
|  - Canvas 2D Game   |     Transactions            |                      |
|  - Leaderboard      | --------------------------> |  ReactiveTowerArena  |
|  - Wallet Connect   |     (ethers.js)             |  Smart Contract      |
|  - Spectator Mode   |                             |                      |
|                     |     ScoreSubmitted --------> |  Events:             |
|  Reactivity:        |     NewGlobalLeader -------> |  GameStarted         |
|  WebSocket sub to   |     (pushed, not polled)    |  ScoreSubmitted      |
|  contract events    |                             |  NewGlobalLeader     |
+---------------------+                             +----------------------+
```

### Smart Contract Layer

**Contract:** `ReactiveTowerArena.sol`

Core Responsibilities:
- Store player high scores
- Maintain global leaderboard state (sorted top 10)
- Emit structured events
- Ensure fairness and integrity

Key Events (primary data drivers for UI):
- `GameStarted(address indexed player)`
- `ScoreSubmitted(address indexed player, uint256 score)`
- `NewGlobalLeader(address indexed player, uint256 score)`

### Frontend Layer

Built with:
- React (Vite) — component architecture
- TailwindCSS — dark arcade theme with neon accents
- Canvas API — 2D game rendering at 60fps
- Ethers.js — wallet + contract interaction
- Somnia Reactivity SDK — WebSocket event subscriptions

UI Modules:
- Wallet connection panel
- Game engine canvas (charge, aim, fire, combos, crits)
- Live leaderboard (reactive updates)
- Global leader banner (animated)
- Spectator mode (no wallet required)

---

## Reactivity Implementation

The frontend subscribes to contract events via WebSocket using Somnia's RPC:

```javascript
// useReactivity.js — No polling, pure event-driven
const wsProvider = new ethers.WebSocketProvider(SOMNIA_WS_URL);
const contract = new ethers.Contract(CONTRACT_ADDRESS, ABI, wsProvider);

// Subscribe — events are PUSHED by the chain
contract.on("ScoreSubmitted", (player, score) => {
  // Instantly refresh leaderboard for all connected users
  fetchLeaderboard();
});

contract.on("NewGlobalLeader", (player, score) => {
  // Animate "NEW LEADER" badge + confetti
  triggerNewLeaderAlert(player, score);
});
```

This is NOT polling. Somnia's sub-second finality combined with WebSocket event subscriptions means updates arrive within milliseconds of block confirmation.

## Deployment Order (for Somnia Reactivity)

Run in this exact order:

1. `npm run deploy:testnet` → deploys ReactiveTowerArena, note the address
2. Set `GAME_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=<address from step 1>` in `.env`
3. `npm run deploy:reactor` → deploys CannonReignReactor, note the address  
4. Set `REACTOR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=<address from step 3>` in `.env`
5. Set `VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` and `VITE_REACTOR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` in `frontend/.env`
6. `npm run subscription:create` → creates the on-chain subscription (requires 32+ SOMI)
7. `npm run subscription:list` → verify subscription is active
8. `cd frontend && npm run dev` → start frontend

The on-chain reactor now automatically reacts to all game events — no backend required.

## Demo Flow

1. **Connect wallet** — Click "Connect Wallet", switch to Somnia Testnet
2. **Start game** — Calls `startGame()` on-chain, initializes session
3. **Play** — Aim with mouse, hold to charge, release to fire, chain combos
4. **Submit score** — Calls `submitScore()` on-chain, score immutably recorded
5. **Open spectator page** — Watch the leaderboard update in real-time
6. **Open second wallet** — Submit a higher score from another account
7. **Watch the leaderboard** — Both the player view and spectator view update instantly via Somnia Reactivity
